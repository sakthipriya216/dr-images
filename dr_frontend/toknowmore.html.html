  <h1 >Diabetic retinopathy</h1>
  <h5>Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. It's caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina).</h5>

    <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
    <h1 >Diabetic retinopathy</h1>
    <p>Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that can cause vision loss and blindness in people who have diabetes. 
      It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye).</p>
    <p>At first, diabetic retinopathy might cause no symptoms or only mild vision problems. But it can lead to blindness.

The condition can develop in anyone who has type 1 or type 2 diabetes. 
The longer you have diabetes and the less controlled your blood sugar is, the more likely you are to develop this eye complication.</p>

 <div class="main">
    <h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
    <p>You might not have symptoms in the early stages of diabetic retinopathy. As the condition progresses, you might develop:</p>

Spots or dark strings floating in your vision (floaters)
<p>->Blurred vision</p>
</p>->Fluctuating vision</p>
</p>->Dark or empty areas in your vision</p>
<p>->Vision loss</p>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
  <h2>Causes</h2>
    
    <p>Over time, too much sugar in your blood can lead to the blockage of the tiny blood vessels that nourish the retina, cutting off its blood supply. As a result, the eye attempts to grow new blood vessels. But these new blood vessels don't develop properly and can leak easily.</p>
</div>
<div class="main">
    <h2>types</h2>
    
    <p>There are two stages of diabetic retinopathy:</p>


    <p><h4>Nonproliferative retinopathy</h4></p> 
    <p>Nonproliferative retinopathy is the early stage of the disease in which blood vessels swell and leak.  In some cases, this can cause macular edema (swelling of the retina) which may result in mild vision loss but can be treated. 
       There can also be early changes to the nerve cells in the retina that may affect vision, in part due loss of adequate blood supply</p>
       
       <p><h4>Proliferative retinopathy</h4></p> 
       <p>Proliferative retinopathy is the advanced stage where abnormal new blood vessels grow on the surface of the retina. These vessels may break and bleed into the vitreous, the clear watery gel that fills the eye, and cause severe vision loss. 
        This stage of diabetic retinopathy typically requires urgent treatment.</p>

    <h2>Stages of Diabetic Retinopathy</h2>
    
    <p>Diabetic retinopathy is a progressive eye disease classified by four stages</p>


    <p><h4>Stage 1: Mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy</h4></p> 
    <p>This is the earliest stage of diabetic retinopathy, characterized by tiny areas of swelling in the blood vessels of the retina. These areas of swelling are known as micro aneurysms.
      Small amounts of fluid can leak into the retina at the stage, triggering swelling of the macula. This is an area near the center of the retina</p>
      
      <p><h4>Stage 2: Moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy</h4></p> 
      <p>Increased swelling of tiny blood vessels starts to interfere with blood flow to the retina, preventing proper nourishment. This causes an accumulation of blood and other fluids in the macula.</p> 
    
      <p><h4>Stage 3: Severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy</h4></p> 
      <p>A larger section of blood vessels in the retina become blocked, causing a significant decrease in blood flow to this area. At this point, the body receives signals to start growing new blood vessels in the retina.</p> 
     
      <p><h4>Stage 4: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy</h4></p> 
      <p>This is an advanced stage of the disease, in which new blood vessels form in the retina. Since these blood vessels are often fragile, there’s a higher risk of fluid leakage. This triggers different vision problems such as blurriness, reduced field of vision, and even blindness</p>

    <h2>How is diabetic retinopathy diagnosed?</h2>
    
    <p>To diagnose diabetic retinopathy, your doctor may complete a comprehensive eye examination. This involves measuring:

      <p>->visual acuity</p>
      <p>->eye muscle movement</p>
      <p>->peripheral vision</p>
      <p>->depth perception</p>
      <p>->curvature of the cornea</p>
      <p>Your doctor will likely also dilate your eye to examine your optic nerve and retina using special eye drops.</p>

      <h2>How is diabetic retinopathy diagnosed?</h2>
      <p>Preventing diabetic retinopathy starts with managing blood sugar.

        This involves managing diabetes with medication, balanced eating habits, and regular physical activity</p>
        <h2>Other complications Of Diabetic Retinopathy</h2>
        Diabetic retinopathy isn’t the only complication of diabetes. Blood sugar levels outside of a healthy range can cause other long-term issues, such as:

<p>->heart disease</p>
<p>->kidney damage</p>
<p>->nerve damage</p>
<p>->Alzheimer’s disease</p>
<p>->foot damage</p>
<p>->depression</p>
<p>->skin conditions</p>
